# CART POLE BALANCING

## AIM
To develop and fine tune the Monte Carlo algorithm to stabilize the Cart Pole.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Explain the problem statement.

## MONTE CARLO CONTROL ALGORITHM FOR CART POLE BALANCING
Include the steps involved in the Monte Carlo control algorithm stabilization.

## MONTE CARLO CONTROL FUNCTION
Include the Monte Carlo control function

## OUTPUT:
1. Specify the average number of steps achieved within two minutes when the Monte Carlo (MC) control algorithm is initiated with zero-initialized Q-values..
2. Mention the average number of steps maintained over a four-minute period when the Monte Carlo (MC) control algorithm is executed with pretrained Q-values.
